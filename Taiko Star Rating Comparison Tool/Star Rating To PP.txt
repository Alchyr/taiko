'CURRENT TASK -
streams might need some kind of buff...?


1000 objects should be baseline for a map.
If a map has an effective object count of 1000, it is a normal map of that star rating.
If a map has under 1000, it should be worth less than a normal map of that sr.
Over 1000, it should be worth slightly more.
At 2000, increase by .5 stars?
at 500, decrease by .5 stars?

Important to note, the loss of pp from missing depends on the weight of the missed objects.
First, have x% or something like that kind of loss for a standard miss. Multiply by object weight.
Then, adjust based on effective object count. For under 1000, increases, for over 1000, decreases.



Notes on current pp calculation:
Object count descales a bit too hard for maps with low density. I think. Maybe could buff slightly.
Numbers for star rating are relatively comparable to current, but do not compare pp to current, they're basically 
completely different.
