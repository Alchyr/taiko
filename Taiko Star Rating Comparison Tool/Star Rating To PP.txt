'CURRENT TASK -
Improve implementation of technicality



These are the "maximum pp" values, as in a fullcombo SS.

Let's say 10 star is the "normal limit" of what people can play, while 9 star is ridiculous, 8 star is extremely hard.

Let's treat 8 star as the baseline for a high difficulty play, with a base value of 600 pp at 8 stars.

10 - 715
+140
9 - 575
+125
8 - 450
+110
7 - 340
+95
6 - 245
+80
5 - 175
+65
4 - 110
+50
3 - 60
+35
2 - 25
+20
1 - 5
+5
0 - 0

Afterwards, a bonus is applied based on Effective Object count
250 objects = 1/4 way to next star rating value
500 objects = another 1/4
1000 objects = another 1/4
2000 objects = another 1/4
4000 objects = another 1/4
8000 objects = another 1/4?

It probably needs to scale a bit less, but this is just the general idea.
This reduces the amount of pp maps with only short difficulty spikes and the rest of the map being relatively easy will give.


In addition, of course, these are values with OD 6. or 7? Idk. They will be different with different OD.
